Soothsayer: An Optimized Ensemble Time Series Forecasting System

![Time Series Banner](https://guley.com.au/upload/timeseries.jpeg)

**Soothsayer** is an advanced, optimized Python framework for time series forecasting. It leverages the power of ensemble learning by combining over a dozen statistical and machine learning models to produce highly accurate predictions.

The core philosophy of this project is to mitigate the weaknesses of any single model by adopting a "wisdom of the crowd" approach. It dynamically evaluates the recent performance of each model and assigns weights accordingly, ensuring that the final forecast is robust, reliable, and adaptive to changing data patterns.

## ## Key Features üöÄ

* **ü§ñ Ensemble Modeling:** Utilizes a diverse set of models‚Äîfrom classical statistical methods like AutoARIMA to modern machine learning algorithms like XGBoost and LightGBM‚Äîto capture various patterns in the data.
* **‚öñÔ∏è Dynamic Performance-Based Weighting:** Continuously assesses models based on their recent forecasting accuracy (MAE). Better-performing models are given higher weights in the final ensemble prediction.
* **‚öôÔ∏è Efficient Hyperparameter Tuning:** Employs a fast `GridSearchCV` on a subset of the data with a reduced parameter grid, finding near-optimal hyperparameters without excessive computation time.
* **üßπ Robust Preprocessing Pipeline:**
    * **Outlier Detection:** Automatically identifies and removes outliers using the IQR method.
    * **Feature Engineering:** Creates a rich feature set including time-based features (day of the week, month, quarter) and lagged values.
    * **Intelligent Feature Selection:** Uses `SelectKBest` with f-regression to select the most relevant features, reducing model complexity and preventing overfitting.
* **üåÄ Automatic Seasonality Detection:** Uses STL (Seasonal and Trend decomposition using Loess) to automatically detect the dominant seasonal period (e.g., 7, 30, or 365 days) in the data.
* **üñ•Ô∏è Interactive CLI:** Provides a user-friendly command-line interface for making predictions and evaluating models.
